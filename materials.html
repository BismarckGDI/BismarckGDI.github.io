      <p><strong>Teachers</strong>: Please take some time to review the curriculum before you teach. Feel free to fork the repo to make any changes that you find fit. To add your contributions to the main repo, please open up a pull request and tag one of the GDI NYC maintainers.</p>
      <p><strong>Students</strong>: This curriculum is designed to be taught, while these slides are great references after you attend a course solely relying on these slides alone is not the best utilization of these resources.
